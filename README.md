# S11639-01-Linear-CCD-PCB-and-Code
PCB, firmware and host software for the Hamamatsu S11639-01 Linear CCD with 16 bit ADC and SPI interface, intended for Arduino, Teensy and Raspberry family devices that have sufficient performance for interrupts and data transfers.

The directories have KiCAD files for the sensor board, and for a carrier for a Teensy 4.0 with connectors matching the sensor board.  The envisioned interconnect is a short (e.g. 2") 20 pin ribbon cable for logic signals and $\mathrm V_D$ and a two wire cable for 5V power.

Status: first article in test.

Stay tuned, will update with pictures and further details.
